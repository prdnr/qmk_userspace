This is a keymap for a rev3 nyquist with the bottom row of the pcb removed.

The switches installed are *light blue Kailh chocs*.  These switches are linear, and actuate with 20Â±10gf.  The light blue switches are no longer made, with *pink* being their replacement.

This keymap leans on [combos](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_combo) a fair amount.

The binary size of this keymap bumps up against the amount of available space when compiled with newer versions of gcc.  If you encounter problems, try downgrading to version 8.
